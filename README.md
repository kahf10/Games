# Overall Description
In the fall of 2022 I took a game desgining class and I created a total of 5 games out of which 3 were solely mine. These were all made in Unity using C#. 3 (Solo: 1, Team: 2) out of the 5 games are uploaded on my professor's wesbite which you can play using the given links in the files.
